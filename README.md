# This is the source code of my old website. The updated site can be found at https://about.akulaurila.com

Saved for archival and nostalgia as this is was my first "real" project hosted online. The sourcecode is messy and a lot of things could have been done more efficiently. I've learned a lot about development since, so to get a better sense of my coding abilities, a good place to start would be the source to [my current home page](https://github.com/Ka-Q/home-about).
